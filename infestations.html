        <p>Dealing with an ant infestation requires quick actions to get rid of the insects and keep them from returning. The first action to take when finding the infestation is to locate where the ants are coming from in your house and how they are getting in. After finding where and how the ants are getting in, the best action is to seal off the area. This could entail sealing a crack in a wall or just closing a certain window.
        <br><br>To keep the ants from coming back, it is important to be careful of leaving food out. Cleaning up spills, keeping food in sealed containers, and cleaning up crumbs, are all actions you can easily take to reduce the chances of the ants coming back. Another measure that can be taken is installing ant traps in areas where ants may enter the house. Hiring a pest control service may be necessary, but taking the actions Iâ€™ve outlined above should keep that from being needed.
